<!-- command: docker build -t <tag> . -->

The docker build command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a “context” (rest of the files in the dir). A build’s context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL. The build process can refer to any of the files in the context. For example, your build can use a COPY instruction to reference a file in the context.

<!-- command: docker push <tag> -->

Use docker image push to share your images to the Docker Hub registry or to a self-hosted one.

<!-- term: container -->

A container is a runtime instance of a docker image.

A Docker container consists of

A Docker image
An execution environment
A standard set of instructions
The concept is borrowed from Shipping Containers, which define a standard to ship goods globally. Docker defines a standard to ship software.

<!-- term: Docker -->

1. The Docker project as a whole, which is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications

2. The docker daemon process running on the host which manages images and containers (also called Docker Engine)

<!-- term: namespace / names pacing -->

A Linux namespace is a Linux kernel feature that isolates and virtualizes system resources. Processes which are restricted to a namespace can only interact with resources or processes that are part of the same namespace.

<!-- term: node -->

A node is a physical or virtual machine running an instance of the Docker Engine in swarm mode.

Manager nodes perform swarm management and orchestration duties. By default manager nodes are also worker nodes.

Worker nodes execute tasks.

<!-- term: Swarm mode -->

Swarm === cluster
Swarm mode refers to cluster management and orchestration features embedded in Docker Engine. When you initialize a new swarm (cluster) or join nodes to a swarm, the Docker Engine runs in swarm mode.

# Kubernetes terms

<!-- term: cluster -->

A set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.
